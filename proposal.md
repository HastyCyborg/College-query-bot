Motive: To simplify communication between college reps and students.
Plan: To have a discord bot taking queries from students, storing in db and reflecting (after moderation) on web portal where techers/reps can respond to them.

A saperate channel is to be asigned for this bot. 
Complaints/Queries should be asked in the format:
cquery <Problem/question goes here>

The query of person will be recorded in a database along with their username.
Then it will be passed on to webpage accsible to Class rep(pending) for moderation.
If allowed the query will further be posted on a website *anonymosly* which will be accissible only to college staff/reps.
They can look on to the query and chose to respond to it in the reply section.

*A timer will be applicable for each query unitll it is resolved* 

Once answered the discord bot will tag the username who asked the query and display the reply.

Advantages:
-Discord is easier to access for students than some web forum
-Queries will be reflected anonymosly
-The timer will be counting on, so it may prevent disregard upto certain extent
